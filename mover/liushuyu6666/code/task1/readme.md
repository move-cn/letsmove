# Addresses
In Task 1, two addresses were created:

1. Wallet address (`0x5386d422ca6ea07e92f39c2293a2af009a2bd59682df4fdd1981e97b40ed8a54`): Used for collecting rewards.
2. Local address created by the Sui CLI: Used for deployment and execution. I have added gas to this address on the testnet for upcoming tasks.

# Publish
1. The package, accessible at https://testnet.suivision.xyz/package/0xbb227ff103ff464df35076ef8c3d232ecc379c5fd5362a6bcb265d9d1c09ab09, has been successfully published to the testnet using the local address.
2. The "hello move" object has been created and is now available. It can be viewed on [suiscan at this link](https://suiscan.xyz/testnet/object/0xc53998923b4a62b9c858028ad204945bcb0f71c9cfa0dbfd2db4551b39a10520).
